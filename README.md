# Vulnerability UI
Red Hat Insights Vulnerability service is used to assess and monitor the status of security vulnerabilities on RHEL systems, understand the level of exposure of infrastructure, and plan a course of action. This is the front-end repository for this service.

## First time setup
1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version >= 16 installed
2. Run [script to patch your `/etc/hosts`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-proxy/blob/master/scripts/patch-etc-hosts.sh)
3. Make sure you are using [Red Hat proxy](http://hdn.corp.redhat.com/proxy.pac)

## Running locally
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Run development server with `npm run start:proxy:beta`
3. Local version of the app will be available at https://stage.foo.redhat.com:1337/preview/insights/vulnerability/

## Running with another app

Applications on console.redhat.com are webpack federated modules, and you are able to deploy some of them locally. This helps to see if new changes work well in terms of integration.

If you want to see local changes to any of the Inventory components, and see how it behaves with other applications (like, for example, Inventory table is imported in Advisor), you will have to run both Inventory and desired application. 

### Example

We'll take for example [insights-advisor-frontend](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-advisor-frontend) application as app that uses system detail.

Open new terminal and navigate to desired application (for instance insights-advisor-frontend) and run it (make sure to run it on a different port):
```
npm run start:proxy -- --port=8003
```

Run the Inventory application with proxy enabled and list of additional applications:
```
LOCAL_API=advisor:8003~https npm run start:proxy
```

Or, if you want to run Advisor and, for instance, Vulnerability, then just add a new entry to LOCAL_API:
```
LOCAL_API=advisor:8003~https,vulnerability:8004
```

## Testing
[Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) are used as the testing frameworks
- ```npm run test``` - run all tests
- ```npm run test:ct``` - run all Cypress tests
- ```npm run test:jest``` - run all Jest tests
- ```npm run test:jest -- testName``` - run Jest tests for all components matching `testName`
- ```npm run test:jest:update``` - run all Jest tests and update snapshots
- ```npm run test:jest:watch``` - run Jest tests in watch mode
- ```npm run lint``` - run linter

## Deploying
Any push to the following branches will trigger a build in [vulnerability-ui-build repository](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/vulnerability-ui-build) which will deploy to corresponding environment. Travis is used to deploy the application.

| Push to branch in this repo  | Updated branch in build repo  | Environment       | Available at
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :---------------- | :-----------
| master                       | stage-beta                    | stage beta        | https://console.stage.redhat.com/preview
| stage-stable                 | stage-stable                  | stage stable      | https://console.stage.redhat.com

## Internationalization

### Translation keys
Translation keys are saved in [`messages.js`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/vulnerability-ui/blob/master/src/Messages.js). 

### Generating translation keys
Each time you add a new translation keys you need to run `npm run translations`, which will automatically generate JSON files for every language into [`locales/`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/vulnerability-ui/tree/master/locales) folder based on the entries in the [`messages.js`](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/vulnerability-ui/blob/master/src/Messages.js). 

### Using translated strings
There are two ways to use translated strings:
1. With `intl.formatMessage(messages.messageId)`
2. With `<FormattedMessage {...messages.messageId}/>`

## Design System
This project uses [Patternfly React](https://github.com/patternfly/patternfly-react).

## Insights Components
This app imports components from [Insights Front-end Components library](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/frontend-components). ESI tags are used to import [Insights Chrome](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-chrome) which takes care of the header, sidebar, and footer.
